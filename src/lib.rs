#![warn(missing_docs)]
//! Rust bindings to libsecret.
//! Many unix/linux systems utilize a secret service to securely store 
//! and retrieve passwords. Examples for such a SecretService are gnome-keyring
//! and kwallet.
//! This library provides methods to access the system's secret service in a 
//! platform independent matter. This is done by linking to [libsecret]
//! (https://developer.gnome.org/libsecret/0.18/), a library developed by the 
//! gnome project.
